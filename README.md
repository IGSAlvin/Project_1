This is a simple weather application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a given city. The application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. Weather data is obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features
Current Weather Display: Users can enter a city name, and the application will display the current weather information, including temperature, weather description, and wind speed.
Getting Started
Before running the application, make sure to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the placeholder api.API_key in the code with your actual API key.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Tkinter
Requests library
Pillow (PIL) library
ttkbootstrap is optional for design purposes

Usage
Launch the application.

Enter the name of the city in the provided entry field.

Click the "Search" button.

The application will display the current weather information, including temperature, weather description, and wind speed.

Future Enhancements
Forecast Feature: The code includes a commented-out section for obtaining a weather forecast. Uncommenting and completing this section would allow users to view the weather forecast for the next few days.
Acknowledgments
